## Component Set Review

Before exporting the component set data, you can review the properties of the selected component set. 

1. **Select Component Set Node:**
   - With the plugin running in design or dev mode (we prefer dev mode), select the `component set` node that you want to translate.
   - This could be a group of components that you've designed together as a set.

2. **Create Base Code Templates:**
   - After selecting the `component set` node, the plugin will prompt you to choose the target development environment (Typescript, React, Angular, or Flutter).
   - Once you've selected the target environment, the plugin will generate base code templates for the selected `component set`.
   - Review the generated code and make any necessary adjustments before exporting.

## Exporting Code

After generating the base code templates, you can export the code to your preferred development environment. Follow these steps to export the code:

1. **Review Generated Code:**
   - Take a moment to review the generated code to ensure accuracy and completeness.
   - Make any necessary adjustments or customizations according to your project requirements.

2. **Copy Code:**
   - Once you're satisfied with the generated code, click on the "Copy Code" button to copy it to your clipboard.

3. **Paste Code into Development Environment:**
   - Open your preferred code editor or development environment.
   - Navigate to the appropriate files or components where you want to integrate the code.
   - Paste the copied code into the respective files or components.

4. **Save and Integrate:**
   - Save the changes to your codebase.
   - Test the functionality of the translated component set in your development environment to ensure everything works as expected.
   - Integrate the new style props and settings with your existing functional code.

## Exporting Component Set JSON Data

After selecting the component set node, you'll have the option to export the component set data in JSON format. Here's how to do it:

1. **Download JSON Files:**
   - You'll have the option to download two JSON files:
     - **Compressed Component Set Data:** This file contains the most useful parts of the component set data, optimized for component development.
     - **Translation of Variant Styles Sets:** This file includes translations of each variant's style sets, making it easier to integrate styles into your development environment.
