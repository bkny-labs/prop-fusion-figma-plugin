# Output Improvements needed
1. Angular
   - module and .spec.ts file generation
2. React
3. SCSS support
4. IDea: Before clicking create / generate code - the user selects a specific drill down they want:
      1. Select Framework (Angular, react, flutter)
      2. Select SCSS or CSS
      3. Select Gemini or not
      4. For react, select TSX or JSX styles
5. Copy to clipboard is actually still busted....



# Discussion
1. Gemini - maybe to use this better, we need to drill down on the specific code style before hand.
