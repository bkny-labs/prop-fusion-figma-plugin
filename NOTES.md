# Output Improvements needed
1. Need more impactful code templates - the current ones need more structure added to them
2. Angular
   - module and .spec.ts file generation
3. React
4. SCSS support
5. Before clicking create / generate code - the user configures the create settings:
      1. Select Framework (Angular, react, flutter)
      2. Select SCSS or CSS
      3. Select Gemini or not
      4. For react, select TSX or JSX styles
6. Copy to clipboard is actually still busted....

# Discussion
1. Gemini - maybe to use this better, we need to drill down on the specific code style before hand. 

# Pro Version

1. Connect component to Github (similar to how code connect works in Figma)
2. Save to Github (similar to how Tokens studio does it)
